### setup

I went with a simple built in solution for the APi key (.env), for that you can just run `echo REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE > .env`

### `yarn start`

### `yarn test`

### tech debts

- no error handling on api calls and so on
- the Network conversion all the time could perhaps beign improved
- i'm also not very experienced with TS so perhaps some of the best practices arent in place
- no styling :)
